					<h2>(Internship) Automation Developer - Raccoon Marketing Digital</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">March 2019 - September 2019</p>
					<p>
						I worked as an developer intern on an Digital Marketing agency. My role was to write scripts that automated the other teams' work.
                        <br><br>
                        The scripts were focused on tasks such as automatic filling of sheets with data from many sources, and sometimes firing alerts based on marketing metrics. Also helped the data science team to write and deploy metric forecasting scripts. It was common to write libraries, wrappers for APIs and auxiliary scripts to be consumed by the Automation team.
						<br><br>
                        Had experience with dealing with clients (other employees from the company), this taught me about soft skills like expectation management, and deep diving to understanding others' day-to-day work so I could find solutions to their problems.
